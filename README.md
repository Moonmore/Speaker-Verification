# Speaker-Verification
paper: Addressing Text-dependent Speaker Verification Using Singing Speech
This document is intended to introduce the system and data of the paper.
Three speaker recognition systems are respectively under the corresponding files
	1.GMM system
		GMM model based on Alize platform
	2.X-vector
		The X-vector neural network model has a Readme file on the Kaldi platform 
		and the corresponding file, which shows how our Kaldi experiment.
	3.DTW
		The DTW model is in the corresponding folder. 
		For the convenience of use, I used some Chinese comments in it.
		When used, the corresponding train folder and test folder correspond 
		to training data and test data respectively.

 In addition to the three model introductions, we have also published our database on the Zenodo ,
 the detailed address is: https://zenodo.org/record/3241566
 Data description in the data folder.
 
 Then, give the results of all trials files and corresponding model generation.
